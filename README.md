### 🦀 Hello Rust — Language Basics

The **hello_rust** directory contains a series of **10 progressive exercises** designed to discover and practice the **fundamentals of Rust**.  
The goal is to get familiar with the language, its syntax, and its logic through simple but well-structured exercises.

Throughout this module, I worked on:

- the **structure of a Rust project** and the use of **Cargo** (`cargo run`, file organization),
- **console output** using the `println!` macro,
- **variable declaration** (`let`, mutability, type inference),
- **basic types** (`i32`, `bool`, `String`, `&str`),
- **arithmetic operations** and common pitfalls of integer division,
- **conditions** (`if / else`) and comparisons,
- **loops** (`for`, `while`, inclusive/exclusive ranges),
- **arrays** and iteration with `iter()` and `enumerate()`,
- **creating and using functions**,
- **passing data by reference** (`&`) and slices.

Each exercise is isolated in its own module and can be activated individually from `main.rs`, making experimentation and concept understanding easier.  
This module provides a **solid foundation** before moving on to more advanced Rust concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
